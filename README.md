# Recipes - The Odin Project

## Introduction

Assignment 1 of the The Odin Project is to create a webpage using only HTML to display a selection of recipes. It challenges the student to use everything they have learnt so far about HTML. It won't look pretty, but it will be functional

## Reflection

I found the syntax and rules of HTML quite simple to navigate. It felt rather intuitive and clear how to apply the rules to construct a simple webpage.
